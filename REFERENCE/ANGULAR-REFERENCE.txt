  1. Identify the number of components 
  2. Identify the hierarchy of components

  Single Page Apps

    7 Characteristics 
    ---
      1. Pages should not refresh [DONE]
      2. URL should change [DONE]
      3. History should be maintained [DONE]
      4. Header and footer should be intact [DONE]
      5. Section in between header and footer should be updated [DONE]
      6. Active menu should be set [TODO]
      7. Page Title should also be set [TODO]
    
  ---
    Step 0: 
      Identify the URLs and matching components 

        localhost:4200/           - HomeComponent 
        localhost:4200/concepts   - ConceptsComponent 
        localhost:4200/about      - AboutComponent 

    Step 1:
    --  
      LEt's setup the URLs in menu.comp.html 

    Step 2: 
    =----
      Let's create the components. 
        ng g c home -t -s 
        ng g c concepts -s 
        ng g c about -s 

    Step 3: 
    --
      Let's check the app. The URLs are not stable. 

      Let's config the routes in app-routing.module.ts 

    Step 4: 
    --
      Let's check the app. The URLs are stable. But the comp is not loaded in b/w header and footer

      In app.comp.html in between header and footer, let's load the config comps. 

      <router-outlet></router-outlet>

    Step 5: 
    ---
      Let's check the app. Pages are refreshed. Let's fix it. 

      in menu.comp.html -- replace all href to routerLink

Coding Practices 
-------------
  Casing Types 
  ------------- 
    1. PascalCase 
        * recommended for classes, interfaces (Ex: class Car, interface IUser)

    2. camelCase 
        * recommended for variables, const, methods 
        * recommended for attribute directives 

    3. kebab-case
        * recommended for component selectors (Ex: app-root)
        * preferred for css classes  (Ex: btn-primary)
    
    4. snake_case
        * never ever use this 
        * okay for const if architect accepts 
          (ex: const MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT = 10 )

Data Binding 
---
  comp.TS => comp.HTML 

  1. Interpolation [DONE] 
      TS => HTML 
      {{ }}

  2. Property Binding [DONE]
      TS => HTML 
      []

  3. Event Binding [DONE]
      TS <== HTML 
      ()

  4. Two-Way Binding 
      TS <=> HTML 
      [(ngModel)] 

      Note: applicable in form fields

  5. Custom Property Binding [DONE]
      []

  6. Custom Event Binding [DONE]
      ()


---

Cross Component Communication
---------
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication [DONE]
      using Custom Property Binding with @Input() 
      using content projection with ng-content -- @ContentChild() or @ContentChildren()

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication
      2.1 using Custom Event Binding using @Output() (child comp sends data to parent)
      2.2 using @ViewChild(), @ViewChildren() (parent comp can access data from child comp)  [TODO]

  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      Prereq: Services, Dep Inj, RxJS/Observables, Subscription

      1. add should take in only numbers as inputs 
      2. add should always return only number as output 
      3. add button should be disabled if wrong inputs entered 

    function add(a: number, b: number): number{
      return a + b;

    (Testing Tools)


Automated Testing 
=====
  4 Levels 
  ---
    0. Static Type Checking 
        Tools: TypeScript 

    1. Unit Testing [TO LEARN]
        * testing tiny independent unit of a component 
        * writing code to test our comp's code 
        * testing the comp in isolation without connecting with rest api data
        * Bug Reduction Density: 40-80% 

        Tools: Jasmine JS, Karma 

    2. Integration Testing 
        * Different units, modules, or components tested as combined entity 
        * Behavior of the app would be tested 
        * Used for exposing issues in the integration of multiple units 

        Example: [testing if a child comp can update parent comp]

        Tools: Jasmine JS, Karma 

    3. End to End Testing (E2E)
        * Testing the whole app 
        * usually a multi-step test combining multiple units and integration tests into one big test 
        * tests are done is simulated browser; there may or may not be UI while the tests are running 

        Tools: Selenium or CypressJS or Protractor or Cucumber or Tosca

  2 Approaches  / Modern software dev methodologies (as of 2022)
  --
    dev writes test cases => dev writes fn code => (TOOLS) => instant feedback of success / failure

    1. Test Driven development (TDD)
        * is a programming Practice that instructs the dev to write NEW CODE only if an automated test has failed 

        dev writes test cases 
          (Instant Feedback of Failure/bug)
            dev writes fn code 
              (Instant Feedback of Success)
                [CODE COMPLETE]

        Testing Pattern: AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)
        Tools: JEST, Mocha, Chai 


    2. Behavior Driven development (BDD) [TO LEARN]
        * is an agile s/w methodology 
        * an app is documented and designed around the behaviour the end user expects to experience

        dev writes test cases (around the behaviour of the app)
          (Instant Feedback of Failure/bug)
            dev writes fn code 
              (Instant Feedback of Success)
                [CODE COMPLETE]

        Testing Pattern: Given, When, Then 
        Tools: Jasmine JS 

    
  2 Testing Patterns 
  ---
    1. AAA (Act, Arrange, Assert)
    2. Given, When, Then 

  Many Tools 
  --
    Jasmine JS  - BDD Testing Framework 
    Karma JS    - Test Runner

  1. How to write tests?
  2. Where to write tests?
  3. How to test our app against the identified test cases?

====

Directives 
--
  * Special Instructions to the DOM 
  * useful for altering apperance and behvaiour of an existing element

  1. Components -- (are also directives only )
      Used with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.

  2. Attribute Directives 
      Example: routerLink, routerLinkActive, ngModel, ngClass, ngStyle, ngForm, ngNativeValidate

  3. Structural Directives
      * the impact will be in structural layer (html)
      *ngIf, *ngFor, ngSwitch 

  4. Custom Attribute Directives 
      ng g d concepts/directives/colorizer 
    
  5. Custom Structural Directives 

Employee Management CRUD App 
--
  
  Create an Employee  (CREATE)
    localhost:4200/employees/add        Component: AddEmployeeComponent 

    ng g c employees/components/add-employee -s 

  List Employees (READ)
    localhost:4200/employees/           Component: ListEmployeesComponent 

    ng g c employees/components/list-employees -s 

  Show Employee Details (READ)
    localhost:4200/employees/1          Component: EmployeeDetailsComponent 

    ng g c employees/components/employee-details -s 

  Update Employee (UPDATE)
    localhost:4200/employees/1          Component: EmployeeDetailsComponent 

  Delete Employee (DELETE)
    localhost:4200/employees/1          Component: EmployeeDetailsComponent 


Modules 
--
  Feature Module 

  Feature Routing Module


  Step 1: 
  --
    Create a Feature Module for the employees and connect with the App Module 

      ng g m employees/employees -m=app --flat 

  Step 2: 
  --
    Create a Feature Routing Module for employees and connect with employees Module 
      
      ng g m employees/employees-routing -m=employees --flat 

  Step 3: 
  --
    Create the necessary components for the employees feature 

  Step 4: 
  --  
    config the URL's for the feature in feature routing module 

  Step 5: 
  --  
    work on validations

  Step 6:
  --
    work on form submission       

Forms in Angular 
---
  1. Template Driven Forms
      * will be developed in html 
      * easiest 
      * validations can be implemented through Directives 

      Disadvantages
      ---
        1. Not Suitable for complex form validations 
        2. Not Suitable for Unit Testing 

  2. Reactive Forms [RECOMMENDED]
      * will be developed with HTML + TS
      * easy 
      * validations can be implemented through validators 

      Advantages
      ---
        1. Suitable for complex form validations 
        2. Suitable for Unit Testing 

----
Pipes 
---
  * Tiny utilities to transform info from one format to another 

  Built-in Pipes 
  --
    lowercase, uppercase

  1. Pure Pipes 
  2. Impure Pipes 

----
Interfaces  for models 
--
  ng g interface Employee  (or)
  ng g interface IEmployee (or)
  ng g interface Employee --type=model // will get filename with .model.ts 

Classes for Model 
---
  ng g cl Employee  (or)
  ng g cl Employee --type=model   // will get filename with .model.ts
